      "# CarePad - Autókarcolás védelemre ajánlott a garázsodban. A legkisebb karcolás a fényezésen, a legkisebb horpadás a jármű karosszériáján jelentősen csökkentheti a tárgy piaci értékét. Emellett magas javítási költségekkel is számolnunk kell és még a biztosítási bónusz besorolásunkat is elveszíthetjük. Tehát van okunk gondosan védeni tárgyainkat és őrizni épségüket. Ha a garázsban ütköznénk a falnak, az épület falazatában is kárt tehetünk, amit szintén jobb elkerülni. Nem utolsósorban el kell kerülnünk az emberi életre is veszélyes helyzeteket és sérüléseket megfelelő védőfelszerelések alkalmazásával. ## Tulajdonságok * térhálós PE hab * vastagság: 10-15 mm * több méretben kapható * igény szerint különféle sűrűséggel rendelhető, akár tekercsben is * használható falakon, oszlopokon, ajtókon, magángarázsokban, bevásárlóközpontok parkolóiban, stb. | ---|--- ## Alkalmazás * Egyszerűen távolítsa el az öntapadó fóliát a termék hátulján és ragassza a CarePad terméket a garázs megtisztított falára. * Alkalmazási hőmérséklet: tiszta felületre felragasztva –40°C és +70°C között ## Jellemzők * Öntapadó fólia a termék hátulján a könnyű felhelyezés érdekében * Csekély tömeg/könnyen szállítható * Rugalmas * Nagyon erős tapadás * Jó mechanikai ellenálló képesség * Mérettartó * Víztaszító * Nem tartalmaz mérgező anyagot * Környezetbarát * Esztétikus * Igény szerinti színekben is * Személyre szabható pl. logó használatával | ---|---\n",

Emellett magas javítási költségekkel is számolnunk kell és még a biztosítási bónusz besorolásunkat is elveszíthetjük. Tehát van okunk gondosan védeni tárgyainkat és őrizni épségüket. Ha a garázsban ütköznénk a falnak, az épület falazatában is kárt tehetünk, amit szintén jobb elkerülni.
